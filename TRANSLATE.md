Translating RustWeb
===================
The web app uses a set of language files to enable translation into the language of your choise. These are located inside the 'www' directory, more precicesly in 'www/i18n'.

To translate the interface, take 'www/i18n/de.json' as a starting point and replace the right hand side of the texts to your language. Just make sure always to leave the placeholders unchanged.
